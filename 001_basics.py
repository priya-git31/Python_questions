# -----------Variables

# How do you change the value of a?
a = 13 
print(a)

# What happens when you try to use a variable c that has not been defined?
#You get an error 

# Can a variable name start with a number, like 1var?
#No, It cannot 

# How would you declare a new variable d and assign it the sum of a and b?
d = a + b 
print(d)

# -------------- Data Types
# What is the data type of my_list and how can you check it?
# Convert b to a string and concatenate it with my_string.
# What is the difference between my_list and my_tuple?
# How do you convert my_string to an integer? (Consider discussing what happens when conversion is not straightforward)

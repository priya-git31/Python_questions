# Two sample lists
names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "David", "Eve"]
scores = [85, 92, 78, 88, 95]

# Question 1: Can you combine these two lists into a list of tuples?
# Question 2: Can you convert the zipped list into a dictionary?
# Question 3: What is the frequency of scores using Counter?
# Question 4: If you want to access Charlie's score, how would you do that from the dictionary?
# Question 5: Can you find the name with the highest score?
# Question 6: How would you create a list of only the names?
# Question 7: How would you find the total sum of all scores?

# Question 8: How would you find the average score from the `scores` list?
# Question 9: How can you sort the names alphabetically?
# Question 10: How would you sort the `names_scores_dict` by scores in descending order?
# Question 11: What code would you write to find the minimum score and the corresponding name?
# Question 12: How can you filter out names with scores greater than 90?
# Question 13: Can you create a new list that contains the length of each name?
# Question 14: How would you check if the name 'David' is in the `names_scores_dict`?
# Question 15: How can you update 'Alice's' score to 90 in the `names_scores_dict`?
# Question 16: What would you do to remove 'Charlie' and their score from the dictionary?
# Question 17: Can you find the number of unique scores in the `scores` list?
# Question 18: How would you merge two dictionaries if you had another dictionary with additional names and scores?
# Question 19: How would you calculate the average length of names in the `names` list?
# Question 20: Can you reverse the order of the `names` list?
# Question 21: How can you extract all the scores from the dictionary into a separate list?
# Question 22: How would you find the median score if the `scores` list was unsorted?
# Question 23: Can you create a set from the `names` list to remove duplicates if there were any?
